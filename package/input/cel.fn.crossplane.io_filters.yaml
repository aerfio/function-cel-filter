              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and

              Filters to apply to the desired composed resources produced by previous
              functions in the pipeline. Each filter matches a desired composed
              resource by name. If the expression evaluates to true, the composed
              resource will be included. Desired composed resources that don't match
              any filter are always included.
